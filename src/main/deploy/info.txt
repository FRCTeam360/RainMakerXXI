Files placed in this directory will be deployed to the RoboRIO into the
'deploy' directory in the home folder. Use the 'Filesystem.getDeployDirectory' 
wpilib function to get a proper path relative to the deploy directory.

In this project this folder is used to store paths generated in the 
Pathweaver tool from wpilib and these files will be refrenced in the
auto command itself. These trajectories must be transformed before use.
