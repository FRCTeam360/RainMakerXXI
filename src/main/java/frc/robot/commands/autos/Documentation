Documentation for the autonomous running sequence and command functionality:

=======================
Newer version: && means parelel and every \n is the next command in the sequential

-Line up robot correctly

-Set Brake Mode
-Drop Intake
-Shoot 3 balls
-Drive trench balls (3 versions)(andThen( volts(0,0) )) &&& Run Intake mostly full power (maybe dynamic power, not overheat motors)
-Set Intake Power to zero
-Limelight shoot all 5

======================

0. Line up robot in aimming toward target, same RPM, only difference between 3 different setups is position on the line
0. Brake mode must be set prior to use
1-3T. seqAutoCmd

    1T. parStepOne
        1B. Drop intake (double solenoid)
        1C. Shooter 3 balls (the 3 we started with) (ideally spin up time will counter shake from intake drop)

    2T. parStepTwo
        2A. Drive Toward Trench Balls, Circle around and come to line - only part with 3 different ways, use if statement based on Constants
        2B. Run the intake, full power

    3T. parStepThree
        3A. Stop intake motion, set power to zero
        3B. Run LimeLight Command (spin, turn, and shoot)

Requirements ( Subsystems )
I. drivetrain, intake, shooter, limelight
    1. intake, shooter
        B. intake
        C. shooter
    2. drivetrain, intake
        A. drivetrain
        B. intake
    3. intake, limelight
        A. intake
        B. LimeLight

Every number runs the letters in it in parelel and the number run sequentially
Start at 1, 0 is driveteam's job, not my code
